This document contains the privacy policy and agreement you accept when adding any of the below mentioned Bots to a server, or use them as a member of a Server. This document does not supersede any of the terms laid out by Discord.

-   **Mara**##9430 (805813096438169610)


### What data we collect

We collect data with different scenarios, each scenario covered by this Policy will be explained below.

#### Collected by command

The following data may be collected and temporarily stored when intentionally provided by a User via usage of a function of a Bot, hence this data is not collected automatically. Should a User provide data in this manner, they forego any rights pertaining to the content of the data provided.

-   User specific configuration settings
-   Data and content for the task called
-   Analytical data
    -   Command arguments (e.g. search terms)

#### Automatically collected

This data may be collected automatically by some Services. This data is used to facilitate critical functionality of Services, and are vital to its operation.

-   Any data needed for standard operation of Bots, such as Server permissions and members. This data is stored in the cache of the Bot, and will not be stored long-term.

#### Collected via User registration

Associated Services allow you to personalize the Service. This is done via an internal registration tool. Not every Associated Service will request the same data, the data requested for each Service is outlined ny the needs of the individual service. This data is stored short-term in Redis.

-   Basic Discord profile information, such as username and discriminator and Discord ID

### Why we collect data

We collect data to facilitate functions of Services, and to provide us with analytical data about Bots’ usage and behavioral patterns.

### Who we share data with

We don’t share data with any 3rd party for any reason whatsoever, unless required by law.

### How your data is stored

All data is stored on protected infrastructure. While storage methods may vary between Services, most data will be stored within enterprise-standard databases such as [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (persistent). Please keep in mind that even with the highest standard of protection, no data can ever be 100% secure. While we strive to keep data secure and private at all times, absolute security cannot be guaranteed.

### How long your data is retained

Data collected via command, meaning collected via explicit understanding that the data is going to be saved (cache), is retained for as long as the instance of the Bot runs. The exception for this is analytical data, which may be stored indefinitely. 

### Your rights to your data

Pursuant to Intergalactic Law, you have the right to request a machine-readable copy of your data for portability’s sake and the right to have your data deleted from the Service.

Should you wish to enforce one of these rights, please send a private message to any developer mentioned on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/QXNDzHCRq8), we will strive to respond to your request within 30 days.

### Feedback

Feedback concerning any of the outlined Services is appreciated. However, you agree that upon submission of feedback, you forego any rights to the content, title, or intent of the provided feedback. Additionally, the feedback you provide may be used in any way.

### Agreement

By utilizing any of the before mentioned Services, you are consenting to the policies outlined in this document. Additionally, you, the Server Manager, agree to inform other Server Members in your Server about the contents of this document.

If you, the Server Manager, do not agree to the terms laid out in this document, you may remove the Bots from the server and stop using Associated Services.
